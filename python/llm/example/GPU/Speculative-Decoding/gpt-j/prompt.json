    "In the year 2048, the world was a very different place from what it had been just two decades before. The pace of technological progress had quickened to an almost unimaginable degree, and the changes that had swept through society as a result were nothing short of revolutionary.\nIn many ways, the year 2048 represented the culmination of a long and tumultuous journey that humanity had been on since the dawn of civilization. The great leaps forward in science and technology that had occurred over the course of the previous century had laid the groundwork for a future that was beyond anything anyone could have imagined.\nOne of the most striking aspects of life in 2048 was the degree to which technology had become an integral part of nearly every aspect of daily existence. From the moment people woke up in the morning until they went to bed at night, they were surrounded by devices and systems that were powered by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.\nIn fact, it was hard to find anything in people's lives that wasn't touched by technology in some way. Every aspect of society had been transformed, from the way people communicated with one another to the way they worked, played, and even socialized. And as the years went on, it seemed as though there was no limit to what technology could achieve.\nDespite all of these advances, however, not everyone was happy with the state of the world in 2048. Some people saw the increasing reliance on technology as a sign that humanity was losing touch with its own humanity, and they worried about the implications of this for the future.\nOthers were more pragmatic, recognizing that while technology had brought many benefits, it also posed new challenges and risks that needed to be addressed. As a result, there was a growing movement of people who were working to ensure that the advances of technology were used in ways that were safe, ethical, and beneficial for everyone.\nOne person who was at the forefront of this movement was a young woman named Maya. Maya was a brilliant and ambitious researcher who had dedicated her life to understanding the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and biotechnology. She was deeply concerned about the potential risks and unintended consequences of these technologies, and she worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the need for responsible innovation.\nMaya's work had earned her a reputation as one of the most influential voices in the field of technology and ethics, and she was widely respected for her deep understanding of the issues and her ability to communicate complex ideas in ways that were accessible and engaging. She was also known for her passionate and inspiring speeches, which often left her audiences with a sense of purpose and determination to make the world a better place through their own efforts.\nOne day, Maya received an invitation to speak at a major conference on technology and ethics, which was being held in a large convention center in the heart of the city. The conference was expected to attract thousands of people from all over the world, and there was a great deal of excitement and anticipation about what Maya would say.\nAs she prepared for her speech, Maya knew that she had a big responsibility on her shoulders. She felt a deep sense of obligation to use her platform to inspire others to take action and make a difference in the world, and she was determined to do everything in her power to live up to this responsibility.\nWhen the day of the conference arrived, Maya was filled with a mixture of excitement and nerves. She spent hours rehearsing her speech and fine-tuning her ideas, making sure that she had everything just right. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, it was time for her to take the stage.\nAs she stepped up to the podium, Maya could feel the energy of the crowd surging around her. She took a deep breath and began to speak, her voice strong and clear as she outlined the challenges and opportunities facing society in the age of technology. She spoke passionately about the need for responsible innovation and the importance of considering the ethical implications of our actions, and she inspired many people in the audience to take up this cause and make a difference in their own lives.\nOverall, Maya's speech was a resounding success, and she received countless messages of gratitude and appreciation from those who had heard her speak. She knew that there was still much work to be done, but she felt hopeful about the future and the role that technology could play in creating a better world for all. \nAs Maya left the stage and made her way back to her seat, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at what she had just accomplished. She knew that her words had the power to inspire others and make a real difference in the world, and she was grateful for the opportunity to have played a part in this important work. \nFor Maya, the future was full of promise and possibility, and she was determined to continue doing everything in her power to help create a brighter, more ethical world for everyone.\nAs she ",
    "Once upon a time, there existed a little girl who liked to have adventures. She wanted to go to places and meet new people, and have fun. However, her parents were always telling her to stay close to home, to be careful, and to avoid any danger. But the little girl was stubborn, and she wanted to see what was on the other side of the mountain.

    "Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a young girl named Sophia. Sophia lived in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. She had grown up in this village all her life, and had never known anything beyond its borders.\n\nOne day, Sophia was out in the forest gathering herbs for her mother's potion shop when she stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. Curious, she decided to follow it. The path wound through the forest, leading her deeper and deeper into the woods.\n\nAs she walked, the trees grew taller and the air grew colder. Sophia began to feel a sense of unease, as if she was being watched. She tried to shake off the feeling, but it only grew stronger. Suddenly, she heard a low growl behind her.\n\nSophia spun around, but there was no one there. The growl came again, this time louder and closer. She saw a pair of glowing eyes peering out from behind a tree. Sophia's heart raced as she realized she was face to face with a wild beast.\n\nBut as she looked into the beast's eyes, she saw something unexpected - kindness. The beast, a great brown bear, seemed to be studying her with a curious expression. Sophia hesitated for a moment, then reached out her hand to touch the bear's fur.\n\nTo her surprise, the bear did not attack. Instead, it nuzzled her hand and let out a soft growl. Sophia felt a sense of wonder and excitement wash over her. She had never imagined that she would make friends with a wild animal.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sophia and the bear became inseparable. They spent their days exploring the forest together, playing games, and sharing secrets. Sophia learned that the bear's name was Boris, and that he had been living in the forest for as long as anyone could remember.\n\nAs the days passed, Sophia grew to love Boris more and more. She had never felt such a deep connection with anyone or anything before. She realized that she had been living her life in a bubble, never venturing beyond the boundaries of her village. But with Boris by her side, she felt like she could explore the world and discover all its wonders.\n\nOne day, as they were out on a walk, Sophia and Boris stumbled upon a hidden clearing deep in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a beautiful tree, its branches heavy with fruit. Sophia had never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"This is the Tree of Life,\" Boris said, his voice filled with reverence. \"It is said to have the power to grant wishes to those who eat its fruit.\"\n\nSophia's eyes widened in amazement. She had always heard stories of the Tree of Life, but she had never believed they were true. But here it was, right in front of her.\n\nBoris nudged her gently. \"Do you have a wish, Sophia?\" he asked.\n\nSophia thought for a moment. She had always dreamed of exploring the world beyond her village, but she had never had the courage to do so. But now, with Boris by her side, she felt like anything was possible.\n\n\"I wish to see the world beyond our village,\" she said, her voice trembling with excitement.\n\nBoris nodded, and together they climbed the tree and plucked a fruit from its branches. Sophia took a bite, and suddenly she felt a strange sensation wash over her. She felt lighter, freer, as if she could go anywhere and do anything.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, she found herself standing in a bustling city, surrounded by towering buildings and strange creatures. She had never seen anything like it before. But with Boris by her side, she felt like she could conquer anything.\n\nAnd so, Sophia and Boris set out on a journey to explore the world beyond their village. They traveled to distant lands, met new people, and discovered new wonders. They had many adventures, but they always remained the best of friends.\n\nYears passed, and Sophia grew old, but she never forgot the lessons she had learned from Boris. She had discovered that there was a whole world out there, full of wonder and magic, and that with courage and kindness, anything was possible.\n\nFinally, after many long days and nights, Sophia found the spellbook hidden in a hollow tree. She opened it, and the pages filled with the sorcerer's magic and wisdom. She read the words of the spell, and as she did, the garden began to flourish once again. The flowers bloomed, the trees bore fruit, and the stream ran clear and sparkling.Sophia returned to the garden, where she lived out the rest of her days, tending to the plants and animals, and sharing the wisdom of the sorcerer and the magic of the garden with all who sought it. And the garden remained a place of eternal beauty and peace, a testament to the power of love and the importance of caring for the earth and all its creatures.",
    "It is done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise - something with a lot of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident that I could fit any theme around it. In the end, the problem with a theme like 'Evolution' in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game? In a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it's not evolution anymore - it's the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that's not something that rubbed me the right way. Hence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn't want to create an 'intelligent design' simulator and wrongly call it evolution. This is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I'd say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I have not seen any entry using this at its core gameplay. Alas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out. My initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn't think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that. Borgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg? The third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it. Conversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the 'Mechanical Underdogs' signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist - by evolving from a normal dinner table. So the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your 'base'. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate. Your plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by 'ordering' them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying 'costs', which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits). Once spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps). Your pasta doesn't like other people's pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill. Once a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate,",
    "“You’re an idiot,” she said.\nI smiled and leaned back in the chair, looking at her over my glasses. “No, I’m not.”\n“If you were smart you would have learned to dance years ago. You’ve got two left feet.” She held up both of her hands with four fingers extended then made a circular motion that looked like an airplane.\nI leaned forward and put my glasses on the table in front of me, reaching for her hands as I did so, grabbing them before they could leave mine. “The next time you do something like this, call me. The phone number is right here,” I said as I pointed at a piece of paper under a stack of papers on my desk.\n“Fine,” she huffed and turned to leave the room. But she stopped at the doorway when she saw the bookshelves that lined one wall. “What are these for?” She stepped closer, tilting her head back and forth as she looked up. The shelves were three stories high with stacks of books on every level.\n“Books.” I smiled again. “I have a lot of books.”\nShe didn’t respond to that so I continued: “And there are more in the basement.”\n“But you can’t move them all here, right? This place is just too small for all those books. Maybe we should look for a bigger office building.” She looked back at me but said nothing as she took another few steps towards the door and then stopped again when she saw my grandfather clock on the wall.\n“And this?” she pointed to the clock, which had been in the family for over seventy years. “It’s just a clock isn’t it?”\nI laughed. “You can say that, but I know better.” It was then that I told her my grandfather’s story. He made that clock, and it was his favorite possession. When he died she inherited the clock; or at least she thought she did. After a few weeks of trying to sell it on eBay, she gave up because no one would pay what she felt it was worth.\n“You should have had an auction,” she suggested, leaning in towards me again. “Then maybe you could get more for it.”\n“No,” I shook my head. “I don’t want to sell the clock.”\nShe smiled, but this time it didn’t reach her eyes. She took a step back and looked at me again, not saying anything, just staring. The only sound was the ticking of the grandfather clock in the background as she waited for my next words.\n“My grandfather made this clock. He did everything by hand.” I could see that she had no idea what to say or do so I continued: “It’s his favorite possession, and it means more to me than anything else he ever owned. So, if you want the books, you can have them…” I looked at her face for just a second before continuing, “but you won’t take the clock.”\nShe finally responded with: “But what about the money?” She looked around again and said, “I think we could make more selling these books than you would get from all of them. You must have thousands of books here!”\nI took another step forward and put my hand on her shoulder as I spoke to her in a very low voice. “You’ve got it all wrong,” I told her. “There are only two or three hundred books. I’m not looking for money – I’m looking for someone who understands how important this clock is.”\n“How much do you want for the books?” she asked, still staring at me intently as she waited for my answer.\n“Forget about the money,” I said again. “If you really want to buy them, we can take our time and talk more later. But if you just want their value in paperbacks, that’s not what they’re worth.” She still seemed confused by everything I had said so far, so I tried to simplify my words as much as possible: “The books are mine; the clock is my grandfather’s. These books have been passed down through several generations of our family and are irreplaceable. Do you understand?”\n“I guess not,” she answered as she walked away from me, still looking at me but not saying a word. She took two more steps before turning around to say one last thing: “Well, good luck with the books, then.” With that, she went back into her house and out of sight, still walking without talking.\nAfter a few minutes, I slowly walked back toward my grandfather’s home."
